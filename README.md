# Carnegie Mellon University Student Senate Bylaws

## What is this repository?

This repository contains sources of CMU Student Government Bylaws.
It was created to streamline change tracking 
and distribution of actual versions of bylaws.
Starting Fall 2017, bylaws are maintained as Markdown documents 
instead of Microsoft Word.
Text nature of Markdown documents allows to track changes easily. 
It also allows to produce nice PDF representation on the fly using pandoc compiler.

## How to contribute

Most of bylaws changes require approval by both Senate and GSA, 
so at least for now we do not accept pull requests.
If you want to propose a change to bylaws, please contact your representative 
in either Student Senate or Graduate Student Assembly. 

## Policies

- Use semantic linefeeds (i.e. at most one sentence or clause per line)
- `master` branch is for actual (i.e. ratified version of bylaws)
- every change to bylaws starts as a separate branch
- merge to `master` shall be done via a pull request

## Installation

On Ubuntu-based systems, just `make install`. 
For other systems, please see the makefile
